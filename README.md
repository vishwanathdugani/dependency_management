# Dependency management for Debian/Linux server packages

Dependency graph for status located in
/var/lib/dpkg/status that holds information about software packages.

This API utilizes a directed graph to manage package dependencies, where nodes represent packages, and edges denote dependencies. It allows for the visualization and management of complex package ecosystems, effectively addressing challenges such as circular dependencies, version conflicts, and the minimization of redundant installations.

The API's core functionalities rely on depth-first search (DFS) for traversing the dependency graph. This approach efficiently identifies direct and indirect dependencies (forward search) and reverse dependencies (backward search). The DFS algorithm ensures comprehensive exploration of all possible paths, making it adept at uncovering complex interdependencies within the package ecosystem.



### Endpoints and How They Work

- **POST `/upload-status-file/`**: Accepts a multipart file upload containing package data. It parses the file to build dependency graphs for all listed packages. Example response: `{"message": "Graph built successfully"}` indicates successful graph construction.
  
- **GET `/packages/`**: Lists all packages by their names and descriptions, providing a broad overview of the repository's contents.
  
- **GET `/package/{package_name}/`**: Offers detailed information about a specific package, including direct and indirect dependencies and reverse dependencies, showcasing the package's position within the ecosystem.
  
- **GET `/packages/no-dependencies/`**: Identifies packages that do not depend on others, highlighting potentially foundational or standalone components.

Running Tests:
`docker exec -it <container-name> pytest tests/tests.py`

This command executes tests in the container and generates a report named `report.html` in the tests directory.

### Repository and Docker Setup

To deploy the API locally using Docker, use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file with the `docker-compose up` command. 

This setup encapsulates the application in a container, streamlining deployment and ensuring environment consistency.

This API stands out for its practical application in managing package dependencies, offering a robust solution for developers navigating complex software ecosystems.
